# AethOS Client Widgets

Base client widget library for AethOS apps.

## Install

Since this isn't an official package, you should clone this repo locally, run `au build` and then from your project that requires this proejct use `npm install ../aethos-client-widgets`.

If you need to update this library locally, bump the version number of this library in `package.json`, re-run `au build`, and from your project re-install using `npm install ../aethos-client-widgets` and then re-run `au build` in your project diretory.

Once this library becomes a more stable (probably v1.0.0) then we will publish to `npmjs.com`.
